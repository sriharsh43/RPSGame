This repo consists the code of the Rock Paper Scissors game which includes index, style&amp;app.js files. The game allows the user to select one of the three
    options (rock, paper, or scissors) and play against the computer. The code keeps track of the user's score, the
    computer's score, and displays the outcome of each round.
