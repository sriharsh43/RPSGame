  Rock Paper Scissors Game
Introduction
In this code example, we have a JavaScript implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors". The game allows the user to select one of the three
    options (rock, paper, or scissors) and play against the computer. The code keeps track of the user's score, the
    computer's score, and displays the outcome of each round.

    Key Concepts
    Variables: The code uses variables to store the user's score (userScore) and the computer's score (compScore).
    DOM Manipulation: The code interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to select HTML elements and update their
    content. It uses querySelector and querySelectorAll to select elements by their CSS selectors
    and innerText to update the text content of elements.
    Event Listeners: The code adds event listeners to the choices (rock, paper, and scissors) to detect when the user
    clicks on a choice. When a choice is clicked, the playGame function is called with the selected choice
    as an argument.
    Random Number Generation: The code uses Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate a random index and select a
    random choice for the computer.
    Code Structure
    The code is structured into several functions and event listeners:

    Variable Declarations: The code declares variables to store the user's score, the computer's score, and references
    to HTML elements.
    genCompChoice Function: This function generates a random choice for the computer by selecting a random index from an
    array of options (rock, paper, scissors).
    drawGame Function: This function is called when the user and the computer make the same choice, resulting in a draw.
    It updates the message element to display that the game was a draw and changes the background color to indicate a
    draw.
    showWinner Function: This function is called when there is a winner in the game. It takes three arguments: userWin
    (a boolean indicating whether the user won), userChoice (the user's choice), and compChoice (the computer's choice).
    It updates the scores, displays the outcome message, and changes the background color based on the result.
    playGame Function: This function is called when the user selects a choice. It generates the computer's choice,
    compares it with the user's choice, and determines the winner or if it's a draw. It calls the drawGame or showWinner
    function accordingly.
    Event Listeners: The code adds event listeners to each choice element. When a choice is clicked, it retrieves the
    selected choice and calls the playGame function with the selected choice as an argument.
